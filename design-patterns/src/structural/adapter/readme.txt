The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them compatible without modifying their existing code.

The Adapter Design Pattern consists of the following components:

Target Interface: This is the interface that defines the expected interface or contract that the client code uses. It specifies the methods that the client code can invoke.

Adaptee: This is the existing class or component that has a different interface or implementation that is incompatible with the client's expectations. It represents the code or functionality that needs to be adapted.

Adapter: The Adapter is the class that bridges the gap between the Target Interface and the Adaptee. It implements the Target Interface and internally uses an instance of the Adaptee to perform the necessary adaptations and delegate the requests to the Adaptee.

Client: The Client is the code or component that interacts with the Target Interface. It is unaware of the existence of the Adaptee or the specific implementation details of the Adapter.

The Adapter Design Pattern allows the client code to work with the Target Interface while transparently adapting and using the Adaptee's functionality through the Adapter. The Adapter acts as a middleman, converting the requests from the client into a format that the Adaptee can understand and perform the necessary operations.

By using the Adapter Design Pattern, you can integrate existing code or components into new systems without modifying the existing code, ensuring compatibility between different interfaces and implementations.
